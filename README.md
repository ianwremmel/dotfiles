# Dotfiles _(dotfiles)_

> Reasonable defaults with customizations

I ([@ianwremmel](https://github.com/ianwremmel)) forked
[Mathias Bynens's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) many
years ago. My customizations got to the point where I made the repo private
because it was easier than dealing with non-public things that might be in my
git history. Eventually, I shared the repo with
[Riley Marsh](https://github.com/rimarsh) and we sort of managed to not step on
eachother's configs.

Our customizations have diverged enough (and we've had reason enough to share
with others) that this repo is a ground-up rewrite inspired by Mathias's
original work, but supporting per-user and per-machine personalization, a clean
history (no secrets from former employers in this repo!), and a first-run script
that can be copied-and-pasted from this very README.
